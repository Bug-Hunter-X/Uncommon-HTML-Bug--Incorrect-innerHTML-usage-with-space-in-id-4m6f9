This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to using innerHTML with element IDs containing spaces. The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.html provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from the fact that the getElementById method expects a single string identifier without spaces.  The solution involves using a different identifier or a more robust method of manipulating the element's content. This issue is subtle and could be difficult to debug for beginners unfamiliar with this specific limitation of innerHTML and getElementById.
